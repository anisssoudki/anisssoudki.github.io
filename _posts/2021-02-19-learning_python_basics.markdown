 this step can’t be skipped. You have to learn the very basics of Python syntax before you dive deeper into your chosen area. You want to spend the minimum amount of time on this, as it isn’t very motivating. 

python is very close to ruby in syntax except for the indentation part which I found interesting, 4 spaces is a tab in python basically instead of using brackets to run a block of code we can just use indentation, also I found interesting closing if else statements or for loops 

```
 for _ in range(10):
   random_integer = random.randint(0, MAX_LIMIT)
   Keep appending random characters using chr(x)
   random_string += (chr(random_integer))

```
 above is a little example of how python looks like notice the : as well how the indentation works.
 this is part 1 from python basics I will probably write a blog every week until i get to learn Django which is the famous framework that is used to build API's in python.
