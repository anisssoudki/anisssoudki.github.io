as I have been going thru learning how to code, the pandemic has errupted everywhere in the world, so I decided to look at obtaining some data on that subject. I found an api from rapid api and used it to build the CLI project, it took me about a day or so, and it was really fun, full of challenges and very educational. as I took everyone's advice not to build something complicated, the cli app is simple displays data for the user when a name of a country is typed, around the first week of project time, the api was updated so I had to implement some changes to the application, but it wasn't that hard, but the data went up from 249 listing to something around 3000 so now, the problem was the data wasn't loading quickly, I think if the api gets updated with more data than the load will take a long time, and that would project a bad user experience, so in my CLI class in the application i made a control flow method into desplaying the first bits of the application giving time for the data to load as the user watches the command line type a greeting message letter by letter, I itirated thru the string that was outputed to the console and used a sleep method to make the display a little slower. 

finally, my thoughts on the process is I wish I had more time, but the project is simple and straightfrorward, we have to as students of a bootcamp to learn bit by bit instead of trying to break our heads with something very complex from the begining, I am looking forward to see what else I can build and the ideas that are gonna come behind it. 

thank you for reading, stay safe!
