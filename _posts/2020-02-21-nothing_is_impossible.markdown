**Nothing is impossible!



In general everyone try to pursue what they like but that's not always life's plan for us. 
A lot of times we are stuck somewhere we do not want to be whether its a job or some situation, and we accept the fact
that it is what it is and that's my destiny kinda of thing.
well its time to get up and fight for not being stuck where you are, I chose to pursue the software developer path for 
several reasons, one of them is that its very challenging, the second one is that I have always enjoyed working with technology and even talk about technology with others whether its someone that knows nothing or someone who is experienced.

Everyone have experienced something they liked or enjoyed at one point, mine was computers, I was fascinated by the way a machine worked, but i never really new the ins and outs and didn't really have the time to explore that field up until recently. the amount of insane information I have grasped in the past couple of month has my brain always thinking and analyzing everything around me, simple enough because everything around us in this day and age is a computer or has some computational functionality embedded in it. 

Lastly, I just want to say that I know the road for success is a long and tiresome one, but with enough hard work and perseverance anyone can achieve their goals, and mine is to hopefully finish the program at Flatiron and start an internship or job with a tech company, hopefully maybe build something that helps humanity.
