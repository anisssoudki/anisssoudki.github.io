for this assigment to build a website that has similar functionality to youtube, at least main functionality as in there can be a user and they can sign in and out and post videos, and comment on them. 

instead of having the user uplaod a video i made it to where a user can just copy the embedded code and paste it and the video will appear. 
Also the user is able to delete and update his content only all users can view all videos, anyone who visit the site can view all the videos but they cannot comment on post or delete any of the content.

I built the app from scratch and did not use corneal just because I wanted to memorize the structure of things for the future, I hit a couple road blocks, but it wasnt that hard to go thru as the materials in the labs gives access to everything we need to build this project.

finally, for the styling I used bootstrap 4, I am really not good at styling but  I didnt want the website to look plain and also it was an ok practice for me. 

other than that i really enjoyed this project although it was long and i am looking forward to rails.
